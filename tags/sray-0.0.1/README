at your option, any later version published by the free software foundation (see
COPYING for details).

Requirements / dependencies:
- GNU make
- Xlib
- POSIX threads
- expat (http://expat.sourceforge.net)
- libvmath (http://gfxtools.sourceforge.net)
- libimago (http://gfxtools.sourceforge.net)
- kdtree (http://code.google.com/p/kdtree)
- pkg-config (http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org)

Notes:
- Run gmake instead of make to invoke GNU make on non-GNU systems.
- Libraries installed from source are usually unstalled in /usr/local. If the
  dynamic loader doesn't look into /usr/local/lib, make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
  set accordingly. For similar reasons you may need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
  /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig so that pkg-config is able to find vmath.pc and
  imago.pc.
- XShm (X shared memory extension) is required, but will fall back to XPutImage
  when connecting to remote X servers.
